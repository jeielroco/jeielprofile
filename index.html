								<span class="image main"><img src="images/personalLife.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Jeiel Roco, but if you want my full name it would be Jeiel Gabriel Garcia Roco. My student number is s3781564 and my personal email address is rocojeiel17@gmail.com . I was born in the Philippines and I came to Australia when I was 7 years old, which was the year 2000 and also both my parents were born and raised in the Philippines as well, making me full Filipino. I am currently 18 years of age and my birthday is on the 17th of April, 2000. I can speak two languages, English obviously and Tagalog, which I speak at home. I am fluent in both languages as I speak only Tagalog when with family and English outside of that. A hobby that I like to do when I’m not doing anything is actually creating or editing videos that I believe are funny.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Why am I interested in IT?</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My interest in IT is currently to expand my knowledge about the way technology works, technology such as software, phones, applications, programs, etc. and how I could create them myself. My interest in IT comes from a very young age, I’ve always seen myself as someone who likes technology, most probably due to the fact that since I was very young I’ve been playing a lot of video games and that I’ve always had a passion for computers. 

I chose to come to RMIT as a believe that it gave me the best opportunity to maximise my studies and passion for Information Technology. I believe that RMIT will provide me with the best teaching and facilities so that I can do everything I need in order to achieve at the highest level possible to get a job after university. 

During my studies I expect to learn topics related to databases, programming, analysing user trends and user experiences. I also expect to learn things about certain software and how they accompany and assist the programming of computers and how they function. All in all I expect that I will be taught all the rele
vant skills that is needed to get the job that I want to pursue in the future.
