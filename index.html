								<span class="image main"><img src="images/personalLife.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Jeiel Roco, but if you want my full name it would be Jeiel Gabriel Garcia Roco. My student number is s3781564 and my personal email address is rocojeiel17@gmail.com . I was born in the Philippines and I came to Australia when I was 7 years old, which was the year 2000 and also both my parents were born and raised in the Philippines as well, making me full Filipino. I am currently 18 years of age and my birthday is on the 17th of April, 2000. I can speak two languages, English obviously and Tagalog, which I speak at home. I am fluent in both languages as I speak only Tagalog when with family and English outside of that. A hobby that I like to do when I’m not doing anything is actually creating or editing videos that I believe are funny.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Why am I interested in I.T?</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/likeIT.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My interest in IT is currently to expand my knowledge about the way technology works, technology such as software, phones, applications, programs, etc. and how I could create them myself. My interest in IT comes from a very young age, I’ve always seen myself as someone who likes technology, most probably due to the fact that since I was very young I’ve been playing a lot of video games and that I’ve always had a passion for computers. 

I chose to come to RMIT as a believe that it gave me the best opportunity to maximise my studies and passion for Information Technology. I believe that RMIT will provide me with the best teaching and facilities so that I can do everything I need in order to achieve at the highest level possible to get a job after university. 

During my studies I expect to learn topics related to databases, programming, analysing user trends and user experiences. I also expect to learn things about certain software and how they accompany and assist the programming of computers and how they function. All in all I expect that I will be taught all the rele
vant skills that is needed to get the job that I want to pursue in the future.

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/idealJob.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The position of ‘Senior Game Designer’ is someone that is responsible in satisfying the needs of consumers in the ever-growing industry of gaming. They must be able to provide a game that a consumer would enjoy and meets the expectations, if they want to bring success to the organisation. This position is particularly appealing to me, as I have always had an interest in creating games from a young age and it would be a dream come true if I could get a position in something that I am very passionate about.  

As stated in the advertisement, this position requires various amounts of experience and qualifications such as a Bachelor in either Maths, Computer Science or something that falls under the same bracket. Deep knowledge with the use of software packages related to game mathematics. Have the experience and knowledge of what it is like in the industry side of things in gaming. Lastly, have the ability to properly communicate in a team environment and also possess the verbal skills. 

Currently I have no qualifications or skills that would help me in landing this position. As of now, I am about to complete the first month in Bachelor of Information Technology and I believe that I am completing tasks that are relevant to landing this position in the future. I have started learning the very basics of programming and aspects things related to Information Technology. I also have outside experience from playing games myself, so I would know from being a consumer, the needs and wants of the other consumers in the gaming world and the expectations they ask for. 

The way I would get the necessary experience required for this job is, finishing a year of Information Technology then getting a transfer to do a degree in Bachelor of Computer Science. I would then finish that degree off and then when I finish, land a job at a small gaming company to gather the experience I need before moving up in the hierarchy. By the time that I have finished all that, I should have the qualifications and skills needed in order to apply for the position and hopefully get it.
